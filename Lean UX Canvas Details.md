# Filling out the lean UX Canvas

### Burning problem
Explain the burning problem we are trying to solve from a consumer and/or business point of view. This should always be done in plain speak and a single declarative sentences
Things to remember:
- A burning problem is only useful if it is based on a good insight
- If the burning problem sounds shallow, ask why 5 times
- Frame how people are currently addressing/solving the problem

### Business outcomes
What critical few or one change in customer behaviour will show that we have solved the burning problem in a way that adds value to our user’s lives? How will it add value to the business?

### Users and customers 
#### Demi-persona
- See demi-persona example and limitations, hence the reason for adding “jobs to be done” 
- Will be validated when we do user testing  

#### Key insight 
Definition of insight:
<blockquote>
    <p>“A deep ‘truth’ about the customer based on their behaviour, experiences, beliefs, needs or desires, that is relevant to the task or issue and ‘rings bells’ with target people.”</p>
</blockquote>
By defining the key insight 


> #### Good insights fuel innovation

### Jobs to be done
Your job story needs a struggling moment
Job stories allow us to understand context, motivation and emotions from a user experience in order to create innovations based on human behaviour and people’s needs as opposed to tech or cool features as the outcome

### Product vision 
Thinking and doing become so much bigger with a compelling vision. Larry Page’s vision to digitize all the books in the world sounded insane, but once he started scanning books manually in his office and timing it with a metronome, he did the calculations and all of a sudden it seemed possible. 

### Solution / big ideas
There is no script. We’ll know when we’ve hit gold. If it takes time, that’s fine. 
After idea has been cracked
List features and enhancement ideas based on JTBD insights 

#### Key experiences
Define the 1 -2 key experiences that will make the product sing. 

### Value proposition  
Every concept is a big experiment, which is why we reframe our value proposition as a hypothesis.

### Red Flags

### What's the least amount of work
