# Filling out the lean UX Canvas

### Burning Problem
Explain the burning problem you are trying to solve from a consumer and/or business point of view. This should always be done in plain speak and a single declarative sentences
Things to remember:
- A burning problem is only useful if it is based on a good insight
- If the burning problem sounds shallow, ask why 5 times
- Frame how people are currently addressing/solving the problem

### Business Outcomes
What critical few or one change in customer behaviour will show that the burning problem has been solved in a way that adds value to user’s lives? How will it add value to the business?

### Users and Customers 
By now, you should have spent loads of time with people in the research phase, understanding who they are and what their needs, wants, friction points and emotions are. That's why in our Lean UX Canvas we talk about demi-persona's or proto personas instead of your typical full personas. 

#### Proto-persona
A proto-persona is used to align all stakeholders and take the bias out of designing for ourselves rather then the end user. They are quick to create and although are said to be guesses / assumptions, doing the due diligence with our research we've found them to be a lot more educated guesses rather than assumptions. These protopersonas can always be refined and tested through research. 

###### Creating a proto-persona:
Divide a piece of paper into 4 quadrants and fill out the sections as follows
1. Sketch & facts
2. Behaviours
3. Needs & goals
4. Pain points

#### Key Insight 
Definition of insight:
<blockquote>
    <p>“A deep ‘truth’ about the customer based on their behaviour, experiences, beliefs, needs or desires, that is relevant to the task or issue and ‘rings bells’ with target people.”</p>
</blockquote>

Insight definition is not an easy task, so spend time thinking deeply about it, use your creativity and persistence to craft the best insight you can, as it forms the basis of our users. 
Make sure your insight is targeted, true and fresh!

### Jobs to Be Done
Your job story needs a struggling moment.
Job stories allow us to understand context, motivation and emotions from a user's experience in order to create innovations based on human behaviour and people’s needs as opposed to tech or cool features as the outcome.

###### Jobs to Be Done process:
1. Start with the high level job
2. Identify a smaller job or jobs which help resolve the high level job
3. Observe how people solve the problem now 
4. Come up with a job story, or job stories, that investigate the causality, anxieties, and motivations of what users do now

### Product Vision 
Thinking and doing become so much bigger with a compelling vision. 
Larry Page’s vision to digitize all the books in the world sounded insane, but once he started scanning books manually in his office and timing it with a metronome, he did the calculations and all of a sudden it seemed possible. 

### Solution / Big Ideas
There is no script. You’ll know when you’ve hit gold. If it takes time, that’s totally fine. 
After you think your idea has been cracked, list features and enhancement ideas based on your Jobs to Be Done insights.

#### Key Experiences
Define the 1 - 3 key experiences that will make the product sing. These should be focused on throughout the creation process.

### hypothesis / Consumer Value Proposition
Every concept starts as a big experiment, which is why we start with a hypothesis. Once we've created solution and tested it with users, our hypothesis then becomes our consumer value proposition as it has been validated based on concrete evidence from our users.

### Red Flags
For each hypothesis, identify the riskiest assumption. This is the assumption that will cause the entire idea to fail if it’s wrong. Failure is no problem, but fail quickly and fail smartly. 

### What's the least amount of work
Be creative about the types of experiments we can run to learn whether our riskiest assumption is true or false. Be that a conversation with an industry expert, a user or a Google search, think about the quickest way to validate an assumption.
