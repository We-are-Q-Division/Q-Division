## Just Enough Process not to kill creativity.

We're not in the game of creating robots out of people, creating process for the sake of process and losing those creative minds we've fallen in love with. So we've figured out a process that works the best for us, nothing to detailed, but just enough to keep everyone smiling and on the same page. We're in a constant state of refinement and welcome any comments, thoughts, ideas and suggestions.

## Research

Before we can start developing insights and answers to the questions on Q’s lean UX canvas, it is essential that we have conducted research and spent time with the people we are designing for. 

Because people make decisions based on their emotions rather than logic, it’s important to understand the emotions behind the decisions that people make in their everyday life. 

Depending on the type of person you are, interviews can be daunting, not only for you as the interviewer but also for the person you’re interviewing. We’ve pulled inspiration from the Jobs to Be Done framework in order to focus on the following moments when interviewing users. The approach helps not only the interviewer but the interviewee as well. 
- #### Point of purchase 
    When did they buy it? Where were they? how did they make the decision? Who were they with at the time?
- #### The first thought
    When did they realise that they needed to solve this problem? What were they doing? Who were they with?
- #### Building the consideration set
    Understand what other solutions were they looking at in order to solve their problem? What other solutions did they try? They might not be what you imagine – think beyond the obvious
- #### Be curious about emotion

But most importantly
> ### Be active, engaged and positive. People are more likely to open up and reveal more if there’s no judgement felt.
