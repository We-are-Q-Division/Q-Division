## Just Enough Process to not kill creativity.

We're not in the game of creating robots out of people, creating process for the sake of process and losing those creative minds we've fallen in love with. So we've figured out a process that works the best for us, nothing to detailed, but just enough to keep everyone smiling and on the same page. We're in a constant state of refinement and welcome any comments, thoughts, ideas and suggestions.
