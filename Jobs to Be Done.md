# Jobs to Be Done

## What is jobs to be done?

Based on Clayton Christensen’s Jobs to Be Done theory, the customer is the wrong unit of analysis for innovators to focus on. Instead we should focus on the job that the customer is trying to get done when they are using a product or service. In essence if we compare JTBD with your typical personas, JTBD keeps the goals, needs and behavioural aspects -  understanding the what and the why from customers - and leaves out the who. JTBD cuts to the chase, making it the perfect fit for the lean UX process. It also helps with prioritising information, focusing efforts and ensures clarity on the direct issue. 

## Why it's useful?

If you understand the jobs your customers want done, you gain new market insights and create viable growth strategies.
It helps innovators understand that customers don’t buy products and services, they hire various solutions at various times to get a ride array of jobs done. 

## How does it work?

#### 1. Define the high-level job to be done
  Rather than looking just at what people buy, examine the needs that arise during their lives.  Sometimes the job is much broader than the product or service that is bought.
#### 2. Identify smaller jobs which help resolve the problem now
#### 3. Observe how people solve the problem now
#### 4. Come up with job stories that investigate causality, anxiety and motivation of what they do now 
#### 5. Create a solution (usually in the form of a feature or UI change) which resolves that job story
